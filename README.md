# come-together
My LaunchCode project:  a web-based collaboration tool for nonprofits.

Come Together is a web-based application that empowers nonprofit organizations to collaborate toward shared objectives.
After signing up for a free account, members are able to post descriptions of current projects.  Other members are able to view
these projects and offer to commit resources that may be helpful.  The project creator will be able to accept or reject these offers;
if a member's offer is accepted, they will be able to view and post to a semi-public Project Management Page.

I created this project as part of my final project for LaunchCode's mentorship program.  Some of its functionalities include:
- authenticated user signup and login
- the ability to view, browse, and search project descriptions
- the ability to send private messages
- project creators can accept or reject resource offers from other members
- members whose resource offers have been accepted will be able to view that project's Project Management Page.

The technologies I've used in this project include:
- Java,
- Spring Boot,
- Gradle,
- MySQL,
- MAMP, and
- Thymeleaf templates.
